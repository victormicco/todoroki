title: Introduction
description: A CLI to start projects structured, with the best technologies and most used. Simple, smart and scalable.
---

We offer a lot of project templates, to front-end, back-end and both.

**How Todoroki works?**

You will install the CLI using the documentation right here, and with it you can choose the best structure to your project...

The process of install each package and set it all up sometimes can be a little boring.

_**Use Todoroki and be fast to do it.**_
